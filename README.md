![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/955FRvs.png) Use AI, Modern Portfolio Theory, and
Monte Carlo simulation's to generate a optimized stock portfolio that minimizes
risk while maximizing returns.

## How does it work?

The app works by pulling the stock close data from the yahoo finance api. We
then calculate the log returns and the volatility of the data to see what the
overall trend for the stocks look like. We then generate random portfolio
weights and use scipy to maximize a function that calculates the best portfolio
weights for a portfolio with a maximum return to volatility ration (this is
known as the [Sharpe ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio)). This
is effectively a Monte Carlo simulation to find the optimal stock portfolio.
